# Executive Summary

The key problem is the timeline.

* We need gear to develop the solution
* but fitting to budget requires negotiation with other parties.

_If you need something you can't have then find a way to not need it._

## Proposed solution:

Do this in phases.

### Phase 0: Immediate action

To get things off the ground, **we can just use my lab in the immediate term**.

I have 2 servers and various ConnectX cards and fiber optics we can just plug in and develop with.

Hardware specifics _do matter_, but **we have many things to do before they matter.**

* **Design docs**
* Short investigations
* Software build systems / CI
* OS images
* ...

**I don't feel blocked by hardware at this point.**

### Phase 1 (optional): Lab NICs

**The exception is NICs**

I have many network cards which are very similar to the one we want (ConnectX-7) but not quite the same.
We don't want to start depending on features that aren't in the ConnectX-7 or assume limits we won't have.

We should consider buying one or two CX-7 cards.

### Phase 2: Negotiate for gear in the Hedgehog lab

We see how negotiations go with the other parties and then buy gear suitable for the lab.

### Phase 3: Customer Lab

Based on the results of prior phases, we can refine any hardware selections and then buy gear for the customer lab.

## Advantages of this approach

1. **We can start developing and testing now.**
2. Even if negotiations don't go as desired, we can still pivot without losing too much time.
3. It is always possible that early development efforts will suggest different hardware options.
4. Lead times are less problematic because we have removed a key blocker from the critical path.
    * Rush build / delivery is usually more expensive and stressful in my experience.
